Mini Task 2
	
1.	This was rather a simple task, but I complicated it.
	Instead of adding the 'onclick' attribute to the div element in the html part. I had used functions like "  "id".click(function(){});  "  in the javascript part due to which
	my code didn't work for subsequent clicks. Spent a lot of time stuck, tried calling reload() function etc.., but all went in vain not realising a simple change would complete the task.
	
	remaining was quite easy i guess.
	
2. 	Concepts learnt.
	1. Concept of random functions.
	2. div elements.
	3. Events (' onclick ')
	4. Functions.
	5. id
	6. some amount of css.
	7. inline and internal styling
	8. variables
	9. the 'document.getElementById() that fetches the first element with the given id.
	10. other basic html and css features
	
3.  Experience with mentor:
	He was nice and helpful. Didnt point out any mistake directly, rather he made me find out all my bugs.
	Gave a lot of useful reference links. IRC sessions were chilled out with casual chatting as well. Very patient. Listens to all our doubts.
	The mini-tasks are really good as well. Makes us learn a lot.
	
	Review:
	20 min long. Had about 6 questions. I wasnt able to answer a few questions as I didnt go through the references properly.
	The questions checked our actual knowledge on the subject.
	
	Advanced task:
	Really nice. Gave me some confidence. I was able to finish the first part in a matter of minutes, but I couldnt expand the div element in all directions. Finally got the logic which
	gave me some good confidence.
